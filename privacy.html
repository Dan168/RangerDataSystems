    <h2>2.3 COOKIES</h2>
    <p>2.3.1 Rights Reserved. RDS may set and access RDS cookies on your computer. Cookies are short strings of text sent from a Web server to a Web browser when the browser accesses a Web site. In simplest terms, when the browser requests a page from the Web server that originally sent it the cookie, the browser sends a copy of the cookie back to that Web server. A cookie typically contains, among other things, the name of the cookie, a unique identification number, and an expiration date and domain name information. Cookies are used for personalisation, tracking and other purposes. Cookies may be "session-only" or "persistent". Persistent cookies last for more than one visit and are typically used to allow a visitor to our Web site to personalise their experience. We may use cookies to analyse the traffic on our Web site (such as total visitors and pages viewed), to personalise features or save you the trouble of retyping your name or other information, and to make improvements to the Web site based on the data we collect. We do not save passwords or other sensitive information in cookies. The use of cookies has become a standard in the Internet industry, especially at Web sites that provide any kind of personalised service. The use of cookies by content providers and advertisers has become standard practice in the Internet industry.</p>

    <p>4.2.1 Harm. When there is reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (intentionally or unintentionally) the rights of RDS, or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities;</p>
    <p>4.2.2 Law Enforcement. When it is believed in good faith that the law requires it;</p>
